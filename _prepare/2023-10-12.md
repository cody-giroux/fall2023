**note this is posted on 2023-10-05 because [October 10th is a "Monday" for URI classes](https://web.uri.edu/academic-calendars/2023-2024/#:~:text=Oct.%2010,Day%20make%20up)**

1. Read the notes from October 5 and October 3. We will build on both of them on October 12. Make sure you have completed all of the steps in the github inclass repo from September too. 
1. Start recording notes on _how_ you use IDEs for the next couple of weeks using the template file below. We will come back to these notes in class later, but it is best to record over a time period instead of trying to remember at that time. Store your notes in your kwl repo in {index}`idethoughts.md` on an `ide_prep` branch. **This is prep for much later, it does not go in the October 12 experience branch**
