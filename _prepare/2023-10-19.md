1. Review [the course website releases](https://github.com/introcompsys/fall2023/releases) to get familiar with what content appears there
2. Review the GitHub Action [files in your KWL repo](../tree/main/.github/workflows/) and make note of what if any syntax in there is unfamilar.   (note that link may not work on the rendered website, but will work on issues)
3. Use quote reply or edit to see how I made a relative path to a location within the repo in this issue. 
4. Use [`git log`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log) to view recent updates to the course website from the [October 12 class](https://github.com/introcompsys/fall2023/tree/c10) to the October 17 class release
