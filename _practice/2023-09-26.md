1. Find a resource/reference that helps explain a topic related to the course that you want to review. Make sure that your contribution does not overlap with one that another member is going to post by viewing other issues before you post your issue. Create an issue for your planned item.  
2. Clone your group repo.
3. Work offline to add your contribution and then open a PR. Your reference review should help a classmate decide if that reference material will help them understand better or not. It should summarize the material and it's strengths/weaknesses.
4. Complete a peer review of a class mate's PR. Use inline comments for any minor corrections, provide a summary, and either approve or request changes. 
5. [learn about options for how git can display commit history](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Viewing-the-Commit-History).  Try out a few different options.  Choose two, write them both to a file, `gitlog-compare.md`. Using a text editor, wrap each log with three backticks to make them "code blocks"  and then add text to the file describing a use case where that format in particular would be helpful.
