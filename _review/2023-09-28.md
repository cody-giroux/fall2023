1. Review the notes, [jupyterbook docs](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html), and experiment with the `jupyter-book` CLI to determine what files are required to make `jupyter-book build` run. Make your kwl repo into a jupyter book. Set it so that the `_build` directory is not under version control. 
2. Add `docs.md` to your KWL repo and explain the most important things to know about documentation in your own words using other programming concepts you have learned so far.  Include in a markdown (same as HTML `<!-- comment -->` ) comment the list of CSC courses you have taken for context while we give you feedback.
