1. find 2 more real world examples of using other number systems (either different bases or different symbols and bases) that are current. Describe them in `numbers.md`. Include links to your sources and be sure that the sources are trust worthy. 
1. Calculate the maximum number of git objects that a repo can have without needing to use more than the minimum number of characters to refer to any object and include that number in  {index}`gitcounts.md`  with a title `# Git counts`. Describe the scenario that would get you to that number of objects with the maximum *or* minimum number of commits in terms of what types of objects would exist.  Assume normal git use with porcelain commands, not atypical cases with plubming commands. *If you get stuck, outline what you know and then request a review.*
